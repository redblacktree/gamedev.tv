  question: "What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?\r"
  answers:
  - "Keeper\r"
  - "Beater\r"
  - "Seeker\r"
  - "Chaser\r"
  correctAnswer: 2
  factoid: Harry was the youngest Seeker in a century at Hogwarts. He got the position
    in his first year, which is unusual as first-year students are generally not
    allowed to play Quidditch.
