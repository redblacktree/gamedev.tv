  question: "Who was the ghost of Gryffindor house?\r"
  answers:
  - "Moaning Myrtle\r"
  - "The Fat Friar\r"
  - "The Grey Lady\r"
  - "Nearly Headless Nick\r"
  correctAnswer: 3
  factoid: Nearly Headless Nick's real name is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.
    He is "nearly headless" because during his botched beheading, the axe was blunt
    and it took 45 strikes to kill him.
