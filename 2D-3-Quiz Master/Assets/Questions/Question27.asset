  question: "Who betrayed the location of the Potters to Voldemort, leading to their
    death?\r"
  answers:
  - "Sirius Black\r"
  - "Peter Pettigrew\r"
  - "Remus Lupin\r"
  - "Severus Snape\r"
  correctAnswer: 1
  factoid: Peter Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail, was in Gryffindor House at Hogwarts
    despite his later alignment with Voldemort. This highlights that not all Gryffindors
    are purely good, and not all Slytherins are purely evil.
