  question: "Which of these is not a type of dragon seen in the Harry Potter series?\r"
  answers:
  - "Hungarian Horntail\r"
  - "Swedish Short-Snout\r"
  - "Romanian Ridgeback\r"
  - "Norwegian Firebreather\r"
  correctAnswer: 3
  factoid: The Norwegian Ridgeback is a rare species of dragon known for its black
    scales and reclusive nature. It's not to be confused with the made-up "Norwegian
    Firebreather."
