  question: "What is the spell used for disarming an opponent?\r"
  answers:
  - "Alohomora\r"
  - "Wingardium Leviosa\r"
  - "Lumos\r"
  - "Expelliarmus\r"
  correctAnswer: 3
  factoid: Expelliarmus, the disarming charm, becomes Harry's signature spell, and
    its use during his fourth year duel with Voldemort triggers the Priori Incantatem
    effect, providing crucial backstory information.
