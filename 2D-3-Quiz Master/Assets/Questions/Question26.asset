  question: "What are the non-human residents of the Slytherin House's dormitories?\r"
  answers:
  - "House elves\r"
  - "Ghosts\r"
  - "Merpeople\r"
  - "Snakes\r"
  correctAnswer: 3
  factoid: The entrance to the Slytherin dormitories is hidden behind a stone wall
    in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle. The password is spoken in Parseltongue, and
    a painting of a giant serpent slithers aside to reveal the entrance when the
    correct password is given.
