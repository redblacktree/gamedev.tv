  question: "What object did Hermione use in \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" to attend
    multiple classes at once?\r"
  answers:
  - "Floo Powder\r"
  - "Portkey\r"
  - "Invisibility Cloak\r"
  - "Time-Turner\r"
  correctAnswer: 3
  factoid: The Time-Turner, a magical time travel device, was given to Hermione by
    Professor McGonagall so she could attend more classes in their third year. It
    played a crucial role later in saving Sirius Black and Buckbeak.
